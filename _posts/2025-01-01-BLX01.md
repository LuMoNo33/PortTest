As part of one of the Aerospace Society (SAERO) initiatives, we are working in a research project to present in congresses. Currently, we are working to present an abstract as a group to the IAC 2025 in Sydney.

The plan is to design and develop an electrohydrodynamic propulsed aircraft. For this purpose, weight reduction and thrust optimization are essential. Our unique selling point is based on a low-price ionic propulsed plane. For this reason, thin and long elipltical wings were first consider, similar to common gliders:

However, noting that the thrust of the electrohydrodynamic motor works best when the area is greater, we are currently considering placing the EHD drive over a fixed delta shaped wing aircraft with high superficial area. Taking advantage of vortex lift, as well as an increase lift from the accelerated neutral particles between the electrodes (similar to FanWing devices). The high manuverability, stable flight and structural simplicity allow the development of a prototype.

To further increase thrust, a ducted motor cell will be placed in the middle of the aircraft, with a converging nozzle at the trailing edge to increase wind speed and momentum of the expelled air.

Further improvements to the design and CFD analysis are needed and will be conducted in the coming days.

We are currently forming alliances with the Monterrey-based start-up Splace Labs to develop the fixed-wing structure and ensure the electrical components are symmetrically positioned within the wings.

This project is ongoing and will continue to be updated in the portfolio.
