As part of the student group Monterrey Rocket Lab, we design, manufacture and fly rockets with our own SRAD motors. This paper showcases the manufacturing process of the Amonium Nitrate composite propellant L1101 motor:

Last semester(Aug-Dec 2024), as the leader of the propulsion sub-team I was in charge of guiding new members to design and develop their own KNSB rocket motors.

We are in the process of creating a new high performance propellant formulation with AN and HTPB as main ingredients. The plan is to create Low Smoke propellants that will allow us to easily change its plume characteristics by adding different catalysts. This way, we will be able to create new propellants easily sell them in the future. 

The objective is to use this new propellant in the International Rocket Engineering Competition (IREC) 2025 to fly our Paragon Rocket:

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
